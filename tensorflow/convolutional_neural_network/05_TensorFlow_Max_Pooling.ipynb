    "The image above is an example of [max pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Pooling_layer) with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2\\. The four 2x2 colors represent each time the filter was applied to find the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `[[1, 0], [4, 6]]` becomes `6`, because `6` is the maximum value in this set. Similarly, `[[2, 3], [6, 8]]` becomes `8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the benefit of the max pooling operation is **to reduce the size of the input, and allow the neural network to focus on only the most important elements**. Max pooling does this by only retaining the maximum value for each filtered area, and removing the remaining values.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow provides the [`tf.nn.max_pool()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/max_pool) function to apply [max pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Pooling_layer) to your convolutional layers.\n",

    "The [`tf.nn.max_pool()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/max_pool) function performs max pooling with the `ksize` parameter as the size of the filter and the `strides` parameter as the length of the stride. 2x2 filters with a stride of 2x2 are common in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ksize` and `strides` parameters are structured as 4-element lists, with each element corresponding to a dimension of the input tensor (`[batch, height, width, channels]`). For both `ksize` and `strides`, the batch and channel dimensions are typically set to `1`.\n"

    "A pooling layer is generally used to decrease the size of the output and prevent overfitting. Reducing overfitting is a consequence of the reducing the output size, which in turn, reduces the number of parameters in future layers.\n",

    "Recently, pooling layers have fallen out of favor. Some reasons are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recent datasets are so big and complex we're more concerned about underfitting.\n",
    "* Dropout is a much better regularizer.\n",
    "* Pooling results in a loss of information. Think about the max pooling operation as an example. We only keep the largest of n numbers, thereby disregarding n-1 numbers completely.\n"
